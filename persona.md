# Learning Persona Profile

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-03 (Session 1)

## About Me

### Background
- **Current Level:** Beginner in System Design
- **Experience:** Starting 16-week system design curriculum
- **Prior Knowledge:** Understanding of basic programming concepts

### Learning Goals
1. Master system design for interviews
2. Understand how to build scalable systems
3. Learn to make trade-off decisions in system architecture

## Learning Style (Discovered Through Our Sessions)

### How I Learn Best
- [x] **Real-world analogies** (Coffee shop for scalability, ATM for reliability)
- [x] **Interactive dialogue** (Question → Answer → Build on it)
- [x] **Scenario-based learning** (Uber example, gaming example)
- [x] **Challenging my reasoning** (Changed answer on Uber after discussion)
- [ ] Visual learner (diagrams, charts, videos) - TBD
- [ ] Hands-on learner (coding, building projects) - TBD

### Preferred Pace
- [x] **Incremental building** - Start simple, add complexity gradually
- [x] **Master before moving on** - Wants to fully understand each concept
- [x] **Prefers depth over breadth** - Would rather understand trade-offs deeply

### Teaching Style That Works
- ✅ **Start with requirements/scenarios** before diving into solutions
- ✅ **Use familiar analogies** (coffee shops, ATMs, online games)
- ✅ **Ask questions to check understanding** rather than just explaining
- ✅ **Challenge initial answers** to deepen thinking (e.g., Uber location scenario)
- ✅ **Show real-world examples** after explaining concepts

### Learning Environment
- **Best time to study:**
- **Study duration per session:**
- **Preferred study method:**
  - [ ] Alone
  - [ ] With study partner
  - [ ] Study group
  - [ ] Mix of both

## Strengths (Observed)

### Technical Strengths
- **Quick to grasp core concepts** (Understood vertical vs horizontal immediately)
- **Good at connecting to real-world scenarios** (Gaming example, Uber payments)
- **Can think through trade-offs** (Why 99.99% for gaming, not 99.9%)
- **Willing to reconsider initial answers** (Changed mind on Uber location after reasoning)

### Concepts That Come Easily
- **Scalability fundamentals** - Grasped vertical vs horizontal quickly
- **Trade-off thinking** - Understood cost vs complexity in "nines" of availability
- **Real-world application** - Good at mapping tech concepts to business needs

### Learning Strengths
- **Articulates reasoning clearly** - Can explain "why" behind choices
- **Engaged with questions** - Doesn't just want answers, wants to understand
- **Builds on previous knowledge** - Connected reliability/availability to scalability discussions
- **Comfortable being challenged** - Receptive to having thinking questioned

## Areas for Improvement (To Be Discovered)

### Technical Gaps
Will update as we encounter challenges in:
- Complex distributed systems concepts
- Abstract algorithm design
- Database internals
- (TBD through future sessions)

### Learning Patterns to Watch
- How you handle very abstract concepts (CAP theorem next week)
- Response to hands-on coding exercises
- Retention over multiple sessions
- Performance under mock interview pressure

- **Skills I need to develop:**

### Learning Challenges
- **Obstacles I face:**
  - [ ] Getting overwhelmed by too much information
  - [ ] Difficulty focusing for long periods
  - [ ] Procrastination
  - [ ] Imposter syndrome
  - [ ] Fear of asking "dumb" questions
  - [ ] Trouble with abstract concepts

## Learning Preferences

### When Learning New Concepts

**I prefer to:**
- [ ] See the big picture first, then dive into details
- [ ] Start with details, then understand how they fit together
- [ ] Learn through real-world examples

- [ ] Learn by comparing with concepts I already know

**I understand better when:**
- [ ] Concepts are explained with analogies
- [ ] I can see visual diagrams
- [ ] I write code/implement concepts
- [ ] Someone walks me through examples
- [ ] I teach the concept to someone else

**I get stuck when:**
