# Category 7: Core Infrastructure & Storage

## Problems:
1. SQL-backed KV Store - Relational schema modeling, CRUD latency tradeoffs
2. Superfast KV Store - In-memory caching, fast persistence
3. Faster Superfast KV Store - Write-heavy workloads at scale
4. S3 (Object Storage) - Chunking, metadata, eventual consistency
5. Distributed Cache - Eviction, replication, cache invalidation

**Problems Completed:** ___/5
