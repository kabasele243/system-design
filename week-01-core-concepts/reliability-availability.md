# Reliability & Availability

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the difference between reliability and availability
- Learn about SLA levels (99.9% vs 99.999%)
- Calculate downtime for different availability levels

## Notes

### Reliability (No Data Corruption)


### Availability (System is Responsive)


### Availability Levels
- 99% (Two nines):
- 99.9% (Three nines):
- 99.99% (Four nines):
- 99.999% (Five nines):

## Practice Questions
1. What does 99.9% availability mean in real time?
2. How much downtime per year is acceptable for 99.99% availability?
3. What's the difference between a highly reliable vs highly available system?
