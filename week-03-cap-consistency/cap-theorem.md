# CAP Theorem

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance
- Learn why you must choose between C and A during a partition
- Identify CP vs AP systems in the real world

## Notes

### The Three Components

**Consistency (C):**


**Availability (A):**


**Partition Tolerance (P):**


### Why Choose Between C and A?


### CP Systems (Choose Consistency)
Examples:
-
-

Use cases:


### AP Systems (Choose Availability)
Examples:
-
-

Use cases:


## Practice Questions

### Classify These Systems
For each system, decide if it should be CP or AP and explain why:

1. **Bank transactions (transferring money between accounts)**
   - CP or AP?
   - Why?

2. **Social media likes (liking a post on Instagram)**
   - CP or AP?
   - Why?

3. **Shopping cart (adding items to cart)**
   - CP or AP?
   - Why?
